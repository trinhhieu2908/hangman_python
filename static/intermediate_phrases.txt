break a leg
piece of cake
hit the books
bite the bullet
burn the midnight oil
call it a day
cost an arm and a leg
cut to the chase
easy as pie
get the ball rolling
hang in there
hit the nail on the head
keep your chin up
let the cat out of the bag
once in a blue moon
pull your socks up
raining cats and dogs
the best of both worlds
under the weather
when pigs fly
a blessing in disguise
better late than never
birds of a feather flock together
curiosity killed the cat
dont count your chickens before they hatch
every cloud has a silver lining
fortune favors the bold
good things come to those who wait
if it aint broke dont fix it
jack of all trades
kill two birds with one stone
laughter is the best medicine
make hay while the sun shines
no pain no gain
old habits die hard
practice makes perfect
quality over quantity
rome wasnt built in a day
silence is golden
time heals all wounds
united we stand divided we fall
variety is the spice of life
where theres a will theres a way
you cant judge a book by its cover
